1.general_test： The folder where the general data test set (GDTs) is stored. Easypr developers will judge the improvement of the new easypr algorithm according to the pictures here. 
 Other developers can also use this test set to test the performance of their modified program on the general picture set. 
 Generally speaking, the performance of this dataset is lower than that of native_test. 
 You can start easypr -> 2. Batch_test -> 1. General_test to test the performance of easypr on general data set. 

2.native_test：

A place where user specific image data sets are stored. Put the pictures of your specific environment here for testing, separate them from GDTs.
Since you want easypr to perform well only in your dataset, you can just put your data in native_ Test folder, and then run the test.
You can try to change the image processing algorithm, or you can train your dataset through the easypr training function, and then use the trained model to replace easypr
This model is more adaptable to your data than easypr's original model.

You can start easypr -> 2. Batch_test -> 2. Native_test to test your performance. 

3.tmp folder: store the middle picture of easypr processing process for debugging.


Note: the data in GDTs follows gdsl protocol. Please read the“ GDSL.txt "For more information.
